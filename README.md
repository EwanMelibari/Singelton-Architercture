# Singelton-Architercture
**Singleton** is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that
a class has only one instance, while providing a global access
point to this instance.
The Singleton pattern solves two problems:
1. Ensure that a class has just a single instance. If you created an
object, but after a while decided to create a new one. Instead of
receiving a fresh object, you’ll get the one you already created.
2. Provide a global access point to that instance. It lets you access
some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects
that instance from being overwritten by other code.
